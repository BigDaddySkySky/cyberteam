# Installing Packages

## Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install <Package Name> -y
```

## RedHat/CentOS/Fedora

```bash
sudo yum install <package name> -y

# OR on Fedora, you may need to do
sudo dnf install <package name> -y
```

NOTE:  CentOS is out of date and the repositories are no longer in service, so you may have to manually update the repository list to make it work:
